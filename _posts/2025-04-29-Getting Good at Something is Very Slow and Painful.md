As humans, we are programmed from birth to seek instant gratificatio, avoid danger, time consuming tasks and difficulty. Well, this can work very well for you to survive as a human being if you are a caveman and your only problem is whether you are going to be able to feed yourself today or not. Unfortunately we live in the technology age and you are not a caveman (I assume because you are reading this) these flaws you have will cause a lot of problems in your life.

Lets consider a case where you set unrealistic expectations(these are: assuming there wont be any difficulty, it will take only a couple days, you will get good very quickly, there wont be any pain or disappointment), unaware of the unconscious flaws in your thinking that I explained earlier. You set yourself a goal, you want to learn how to draw and you want to be really good at it. (You just watched Bob Ross got inspired by him, and you are fully motivated at least for now). Now you believe you will be able to draw like Bob Ross in a couple of days, or you believe that it wont require much effort (This is literally what I have made in the past). After trying it for the first time, you face with the harsh reality that you cant even draw a proper straight line yet aside a painting. You realize that it will take significantly more time and practice than you originally expected. Noticing how far reality falls short of your expectations, your motivation is destroyed and you quit in the first couple days.


Learning anything meaningful takes far more time than you expect. And not only is it a long journey, it also involves pain, disappointment and lack of  gratification for a prolonged period. But if you begin with these things in mind, if you accept that it will not be easy and your progress be very slow, you will eventually get there.
